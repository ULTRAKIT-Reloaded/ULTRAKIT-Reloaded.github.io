# Welcome

ULTRAKIT is a BepInEx library for ULTRAKILL that is designed to provide useful extensions and custom content loading capabilities.

This wiki will provide resources for developers who wish to use ULTRAKIT in their own addons. If you are not an addon developer but require this mod as a dependency, refer back to the [readme](https://github.com/PetersonE1/UltrakitReloaded#readme) for installation.

The API heirarchy follows internal namespace heirarchy.
